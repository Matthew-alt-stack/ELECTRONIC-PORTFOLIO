<font size="7"> My reflection this 1st quarter: Coding was always interesting for me. It's fun to know that coding is the foundation of all websites.
It gives me chills because coding seems so fun to do. The first 3 lessons were pretty cool. The hands-on was easy, but it seems so 
fast-paced. We always have to rush, and it puts a lot of pressure. This 1st quarter seems very fast, and we didn't really get the chance
to code more. The quizzes, on the other hand, seem pretty easy but hard at the same time. Our first lesson was HTML. It was pretty easy, 
and it makes me recall some of my coding experience last year. This lesson helped me become more concise in writing codes. The list and 
tables, on the other hand, were pretty easy, but the hands-on was hard. I learned a lot from this lesson, and it really helped me recall 
my past knowledge. I learned how to use other attributes, and I learned some shortcuts we can use. Although I didn't finish the lesson, 
I'm still glad that I learned a lot and did my best on that hands-on. Hyperlinks and forms, on the other hand, became so confusing. The 
lesson became so hard that I lost track of what we were actually discussing. I learned how all this is necessary, and I was happy after 
I finally did the correct code. The codes here were so fun and interesting since I didn't know that it was going to be so easy. This last
2 lessons made me more curious about ICT coding and what more I can do. Overall, this lesson was pretty awesome, and I can safely say that 
I learned a lot in it.  I learned how to make a good structure in HTML, and I learned how important it is to have a correct input in coding. 
I also learned where to look when the code doesn't work. Overall, these lessons make me curious and love ICTS more. It made me become 
knowledgeable about coding and made me code faster. Thanks, Ms. Uminga, for being the best teacher who teaches coherently and is always 
understanding of her students. Thank you, and I am excited for the surprises next quarter. </font> </font>
